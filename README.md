### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alexandre DANG, a french student working on a double master diploma at the University of Sherbrooke near MontrÃ©al.

I studied computer science at INP-ENSEEIHT at Toulouse, France. 
I did an intership in deeplearning, the field I want to work in !

I'm still searching for a 6 months internship by the way ! :wink:
